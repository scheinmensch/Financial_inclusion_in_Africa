*This is the one of the first machine learning projects I've been working on.*

# Zindi Challenge [Financial inclusion in Africa](https://zindi.africa/competitions/financial-inclusion-in-africa/data)

Access to bank accounts enable households to save and make payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to loans, insurance, and related services. Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.

The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. The models and solutions developed can provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, while providing insights into some of the key factors driving individualsâ€™ financial security.
